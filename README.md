## 📊 Key Results & Analysis

The repository includes several visual results from the simulation:
- **Directivity:** Analysis of the antenna's ability to focus energy in a specific direction.
- **S-Parameters:** Measurement of input return loss and bandwidth.
- **Radiation Patterns:** 3D and 2D (Azimuth) plots of the antenna's field strength.
- **Current Distributions:** Visualization of the surface currents on the reflector and dipole element.
